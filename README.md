# Three.js Stars - Interactive 3D Space Experience

A mesmerizing interactive 3D space exploration experience created with Three.js. Navigate through dynamic star clusters, interact with physics-based star systems, and experience smooth camera controls in an immersive cosmic environment.

## üåü Experience Overview

This is an interactive 3D space simulation where you control a glowing yellow sphere that travels through procedurally generated star clusters. The experience combines real-time physics, dynamic lighting, and smooth camera controls to create an engaging cosmic journey.

### Core Experience
- **Space Navigation**: Control a glowing sphere through an infinite starfield
- **Physics Interaction**: Push and interact with thousands of individual stars
- **Dynamic Clusters**: Encounter procedurally generated star clusters with varied colors and sizes
- **Smooth Movement**: Frame-rate independent movement with realistic physics
- **Immersive Camera**: Orbital camera system with mouse and keyboard controls

## üéÆ Controls & Interaction

### Movement Controls
- **WASD Keys**: Manual sphere movement (W=up, S=down, A=right, D=left)
- **Spacebar**: Hold for boost speed (1.0x vs normal 0.12x)
- **Mouse Drag**: Orbit camera around the sphere
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (5-40 units distance)

### Physics Modes
- **M Key**: Toggle between physics modes
  - **Standard Mode**: Direct sphere-to-star interaction
  - **Chain Mode**: Stars interact with each other, creating chain reactions

### Visual Features
- **Dynamic Skybox**: Procedurally generated starfield background
- **Particle Trail**: Red/orange particle trail following the sphere
- **Point Lighting**: Dynamic lighting system with emissive materials
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS counter and performance graph
